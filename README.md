This is the React WebApp Version of my personal Portfolio. It uses data from the sanity.io Backend to generate a gallery to showcase my projects. The gallery can be customised in the overlay, there are 3 views and 5 color schemes. Additionally a 3D-scanned model of my head is rotating towards the mouse position as a fun feature.

## Dependencies
